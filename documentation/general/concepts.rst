Concepts
========

For detailed descriptions of concepts and implementation of the data model we refer to the `publications <https://campo.computationalgeography.org/publications/>`_ of
de Bakker et al (2017) and de Jong and Karssenberg (2020).
You can also find more detailed informatio about the concepts on the LUE `documentation <https://lue.computationalgeography.org/doc/manual/data_model/concept.html>`_ page.

The data model uses the following terminology:


Phenomenon
----------

In the conceptual data model, the concept phenomenon is used
to describe a concrete or abstract constituent of the system that is
being modelled.
A phenomenon contains one or more individuals (objects).

Domain
------
A domain is the area and time period for which a property exists,
for each object.


Property
--------
A property is a particular attribute of a phenomenon.


Property set
------------

A property set
can be thought of as a set of properties sharing a particular spatio-
temporal domain, i.e. the area and time period for which the
property exists.

Value
-----
The value allows for the modelling of spatial and temporal variation
within a domain.
